# Monkey-2DPlatformer

To play you have to download the project as a .zip and open up the Monkey-2DPlatformer.exe. The folder the .exe is the only thing you need to play the game.
The other folders contain some key assets I made (Scripts + Sprites) for the game. 
The game lacks some features like a quit button and more levels and so on but it was meant as a 2-3 weeks long functioning semi-finished project!

(To quit playing simply press alt + F4)

Core Features:
Jumping
Climbing
Walljumping
Collecting Bananas
Secret Areas
(Shooting - not yet finalized)
