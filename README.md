## Some information about the game ##
The other folders contain some key features I made (Scripts + Sprites) for the game. 
The game lacks some features like a quit button and more levels and so on but it was meant as a 2-3 weeks long functioning semi-finished project!
The only assets made by me were the player character, bananas, background, projectile and the baloons. The rest of the assets were copyright free assets from the web (particle effects, music, etc.. )

## Core features ##
* Jumping             
* Climbing Vines
* Wall Jumping             
* Collecting Bananas
* Secret Areas
