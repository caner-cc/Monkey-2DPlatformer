# Monkey-2DPlatformer

To play you have to download the project as a .zip, unzip it and run the Monkey-2DPlatformer.exe inside the Monkey-2DPlatformer folder. The folder where the .exe is located is the only thing you need to play the game.


The other folders contain some key assets I made (Scripts + Sprites) for the game. 
The game lacks some features like a quit button and more levels and so on but it was meant as a 2-3 weeks long functioning semi-finished project!

(To quit playing simply press alt + F4)


Core Features:Jumping, Climbing Vines, Walljumping, Collecting Bananas, Secret Areas, (Shooting Projectiles - not yet finalized)
